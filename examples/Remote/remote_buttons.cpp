/*
 * M3D-Go Remote Example 2: Five Buttons for Basic Movement Control
 *
 * This example demonstrates using five buttons on the BLE client to control basic movements: 
 * forward, backward, clockwise spin, counterclockwise spin, and stop.
 *
 * Hardware Requirements:
 * - Remote BLE client must be connected.
 *
 * For any inquiries or support, please contact us at:

 * 
 * Example Functionality:
 * - Provides buttons on the remote for basic movement control, allowing users to control the botâ€™s motion.
